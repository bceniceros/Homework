    "### Week 4 Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What does one need to do to use a module?\n",
    "    - If we want to use code from a module or a library in our applications, we first need to import the respective module into our code-base. by using the import statement.\n",
    "#### 2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.\n",
    "    - import math\n",
    "        - print(\"Round up ... \", math.ceil(1.4))\n",
    "#### 3. What is a benefit of using Exception handling?\n",
    "    - Exception statements can be used to identify errors:\n",
    "        - `try` - Tests a block of code for errors\n",
    "#### 4. what are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?\n",
    "    - try, except, else, final\n",
    "#### 5. NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?\n",
    "    - Python lists\n",
    "#### 6. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.\n",
    "    - occupy less memory\n",
    "#### 7. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "    - Changes array's data type\n",
    "#### 8. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.\n",
    "    - Searching, sorting, and counting\n",
    "    - Mathematical operations\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra\n",
    "#### 9. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?\n",
    "    - SciPy\n",
    "#### 10. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "    - (Ex: 3-D), length (rows) and size (columns)\n",
    "#### 11. What is a Tensor?\n",
    "    - An array with 3+ dimensions\n",
    "#### 12. Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?\n",
    "    - More convienent\n",
    "#### 13. When creating an \"empty\" array, where do the elements come from?\n",
    "    - The function `empty` creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory."
